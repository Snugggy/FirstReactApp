# First React web app (TodoList)

This is the code for my first web app using React. Minor changes were made, but majority of code came from following along to "React JS Crash Course" by Brad Traversy on Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBws8MSXN7A

## Quick Start 

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Serve on localhost:3000
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build
```
